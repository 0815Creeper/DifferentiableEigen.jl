# DifferentiableEigen.jl
ðŸš§ **WORK IN PROGRESS - FILES WILL BE COMITTED SOON** ðŸš§

## What is DifferentiableEigen.jl?
The current implementation of `LinearAlgebra.eigen` does not support sensitivities. 
This package adds a new function `eigen`, that wraps the original function, but returns an array of reals instead of complex numbers (this is necessary, because some AD-frameworks do not support complex numbers). 
This `eigen` function is differentiable by every AD-framework with support for *ChainRulesCore.jl* and *ForwardDiff.jl*.

## How can I use DifferentiableEigen.jl?
1\. Open a Julia-REPL, switch to package mode using `]`, activate your preferred environment.

2\. Install [*DifferentiableEigen.jl*](https://github.com/ThummeTo/DifferentiableEigen.jl):
```julia-repl
(@v1.6) pkg> add "https://github.com/ThummeTo/DifferentiableEigen.jl" # after the package release, one can use `add DifferentiableEigen`
```

3\. If you want to check that everything works correctly, you can run the tests bundled with [*DifferentiableEigen.jl*](https://github.com/ThummeTo/DifferentiableEigen.jl):
```julia-repl
(@v1.6) pkg> test DifferentiableEigen
```

## How does it work? 
```julia
import DifferentiableEigen
import LinearAlgebra
import ForwardDiff

A = rand(3,3)   # Random matrix 3x3 

eigvals, eigvecs = LinearAlgebra.eigen(A)   # This is the default eigen-function in Julia. Note, that eigenvalues and -vectors are complex numbers.
jac = ForwardDiff.jacobian(LinearAlgebra.eigen, A)   # That doesn't work!

eigvals, eigvecs = DifferentiableEigen.eigen(A)   # This is the differentiable eigen-function. Note, that eigenvalues and -vectors are not complex numbers, but real arrays!  
jac = ForwardDiff.jacobian(DifferentiableEigen.eigen, A)   # That does work! eigenvalue- and eigenvector-sensitvities
```

## Acknowledgement
This package was motivated by this [discourse thread](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/native-eigenvals-for-differentiable-programming/27126). 
For now, there is no other (known) ready to use solution for differentiable eigenvalues and -vectors. 
If this changes, please feel free to open a PR or discussion.
